When I first heard about TDD, the idea seemed to be pretty simple. Just by doing a little word swizzling, obviously TDD is when you have tests that drive your software development.

## The TDD stages:

- First the developer writes one tests.
- The developer then runs those tests and (obviously) they fail because none of those features are actually implemented.
- Next the developer actually implements those tests in code.
- If the developer writes their code well, then the in next stage they will see that their tests pass.
- The developer can then refactor their code, refactor by patterns and with focus on DDD.
